# Natural-Language-Processing
A personal repository documenting my journey of learning and practicing Natural Language Processing (NLP). It contains notes, explanations, and hands-on implementations of key NLP concepts, from classical techniques like text preprocessing to advanced models such as RNNs, Transformers, and Generative AI, including projects like chatbots and machine translation.
